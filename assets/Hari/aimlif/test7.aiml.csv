To fill and empty such a large building very quickly would be difficult. The architects came up with a system of arches and staircases inside the building. With over 80 archways with multiple sets of stairs leading to the seats it would easily be emptied in less than ten minutes. Underneath the seats there were a labyrinth of corridors and stairs. The stairways from the first level rose to the second and third levels. Ordinary citizens would enter the building through one of seventy six arches. The other four were reserved for the emperor and his family to use. This caused the Colosseum to have a very unique design.",test7.aiml
