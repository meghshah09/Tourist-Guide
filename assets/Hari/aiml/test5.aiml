	  The Great Pyramid consists of an estimated 2.3 million blocks which most believe to have been transported from nearby quarries. The Tura limestone used for the casing was quarried across the river. The largest granite stones in the pyramid found in the "King's" chamber  weigh 25 to 80 tonnes and were transported from Aswan more than 800 km (500 mi) away.
