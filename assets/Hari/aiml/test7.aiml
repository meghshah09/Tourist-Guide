      <pattern>architecture about Colosseum</pattern>
      <template>
	  The Colosseum was a massive structure. It covered over six acres of land from end to end the Colosseum was 620 feet long, 513 feet wide and over 160 feet tall. To fill and empty such a large building very quickly would be difficult. The architects came up with a system of arches and staircases inside the building. With over 80 archways with multiple sets of stairs leading to the seats it would easily be emptied in less than ten minutes. Underneath the seats there were a labyrinth of corridors and stairs. The stairways from the first level rose to the second and third levels. Ordinary citizens would enter the building through one of seventy six arches. The other four were reserved for the emperor and his family to use. This caused the Colosseum to have a very unique design.

	Located just east of the Roman Forum the massive stone amphitheater known as the Colosseum was commissioned around A.D. 70-72 by Emperor Vespasian of the Flavian dynasty as a gift to the Roman people. In A.D. 80 Vespasian’s son Titus opened the Colosseum–officially known as the Flavian Amphitheater–with 100 days of games including gladiatorial combats and wild animal fights.
