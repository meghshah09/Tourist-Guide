The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line
across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions
of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe.

 Standing tall, mighty, and unmoved over millennia, the 4000 miles (6500 km) long Great Wall of China is an architectural wonder of epic significance.
 Snaking along through hills, plains, deserts, and swamps, with an average height of 25 feet and housing 25,000 watch towers (beacons) along the course, this robust man-made barricade requires more than just applause to truly appreciate the engineering and architectural feat that it is.
 The Great Wall of China, made up of stone and earthen fortifications was built and rebuilt over several generations.
